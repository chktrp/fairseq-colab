# Train a simple Q&A chatbot using Fairseq on Colab

This is my attempt to use a translation model to create a simple chatbot.

The Jupyter notebook is a collection of codes and scripts from
- https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/translation/README.md#training-a-new-model
- https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/translation/prepare-iwslt14.sh

(roughly) edited and laid out to be able to use Tab Separated Values (TSV) files as inputs. Some variables are parametized but some are hard coded.

The dataset is from
- https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/blob/main/packages/qnamaker/docs/chit-chat-dataset.md
